# DSA Capstone Project - Amazon Product Review

## Project Title: Amazon Product Review Analysis

### Introduction
In the rapidly expanding e-commerce landscape, providing insightful product and customer data analysis is vital for enhancing customer satisfaction, optimizing marketing strategies, and driving product improvements. As a Junior Data Analyst at RetailTech Insights, our goal is to leverage the rich dataset obtained from Amazon product pages, which encompasses detailed product information and customer reviews across various categories. This analysis aims to uncover patterns, sentiments, and key factors influencing customer perceptions and product performance, thereby enabling e-commerce sellers to make data-driven decisions to boost their competitive edge.

#### Objective
1. To analyze product attributes such as pricing, discounts, ratings, and categories to identify trends and their impact on customer engagement.
2. To evaluate customer reviews for sentiment, recurring themes, and satisfaction levels, providing insights into product strengths and areas for improvement.
3. To segment products based on customer feedback and ratings to prioritize enhancement efforts and marketing focus.
4. To generate actionable insights that can inform product development, pricing strategies, and customer engagement initiatives.
5. To develop a dashboard and reports that effectively communicate key findings to stakeholders, supporting strategic decision-making in the e-commerce domain.

#### Dataset Overview
The dataset includes structured product and unstructured customer review data for six distinct products across multiple categories, with attributes such as:
- Product Information: ID, name, category, pricing, discount.
