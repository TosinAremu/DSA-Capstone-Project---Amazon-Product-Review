# DSA Capstone Project - Amazon Product Review

## Project Title: Amazon Product Review Analysis

### Introduction
In the rapidly expanding e-commerce landscape, providing insightful product and customer data analysis is vital for enhancing customer satisfaction, optimizing marketing strategies, and driving product improvements. As a Junior Data Analyst at RetailTech Insights, our goal is to leverage the rich dataset obtained from Amazon product pages, which encompasses detailed product information and customer reviews across various categories. This analysis aims to uncover patterns, sentiments, and key factors influencing customer perceptions and product performance, thereby enabling e-commerce sellers to make data-driven decisions to boost their competitive edge.

### Project Summary
This portfolio presents insights derived from analyzing Amazon products from various categories. The focus is on identifying patterns in customer behaviour, product performance, pricing competitiveness, and sentiment in user feedback. The analysis combines both quantitative and qualitative methods to generate a comprehensive picture of each product's market performance.

### Data Sources
The dataset includes structured product and unstructured customer review data for products across multiple categories, with attributes such as:
- Product Information: ID, name, category, pricing, discount.
- Review Data: Ratings, review count, individual reviews (title + content).
- Customer Metadata: User ID, name.

### Data Cleaning & Preprocessing Highlights
- Standardized Column columns: Unified naming conventions and trimmed product category.
